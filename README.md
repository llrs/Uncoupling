# Uncoupling

The goal of Uncoupling is to to analyze the data from ["Uncoupling of mucosal gene regulation, mRNA splicing and adherent microbiota signatures in inflammatory bowel disease."](https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2016-311651) for integration efforts using [MCIA](https://bioconductor.org/packages/omicade4 "Function on omicade4") and [RGCCA](https://llrs.github.io/RGCCA/ "My modified version of RGCCA") as I propose (using the metadata) and test that the assumptions made with the [glioma's dataset generalize](https://github.com/llrs/sgcca_hyperparameters/).
